we had no choice about the terminology, about the phraseology, certainly not about the ontology. 
coming to terms--minus a lawyerly term sheet (with all the debits and credits  
and loans made in bad faith…plus a little vig for lubricant) to guide us-- 
coming to terms with whose cause was just-er, juicier, more favorable to the creator 
or god or whatever being or life-force or ghost abandoned us, more teleologically aligned 
with, idunno, the world spirit ferchrissake. or maybe my spirit? 
there is sin in my heart. there is evil in the world. come to terms with that. 
come to me, tentenhawitha, come to me and sing with me this song. 
we bawl and brawl over different terms for keeping what is ours ours. 
coming to terms becomes telling a joke coming to terms becomes missing the joke. 
co-term, intern, interim, intern, return. go back to where you came from. 
each adjective has such sharp sharp edges, chopping off fingers and toes and entire limbs in its quest 
for confinement, clarity and consensus. purity, the wolf-lambs bleat 
we must remain pure, we must remain unsullied, we must remain we must remain we must remain we must remain we must remain. we must remain. we must remain. we must remain. we must remain. 
we must remain dead.
